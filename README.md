# Front-End Web Develepment Nanodegree - Udacity
A portfolio of my project throughout the nanodegree period which took me almost 3 months to finish.
I'll list what are the project I did in the order of their date, hope you like what you will see.

## 1. [Personal blog](https://github.com/hesh-alghamdi/FEND/tree/1-personal-blog)
This was our first project to do in the course. They taught us basic HTML and CSS and asked us to make a personal blog but we had to use both Flexbux and Grid layout.

## 2. [Landing Page](https://github.com/hesh-alghamdi/FEND/tree/2-landing-page)
This was our first encounter with JavaScrip. We were asked to do a landing page of sort and make it dynamic as much as possible like making the navigation bar be populated based on how many section were in that page.

## 3. [Weather Journal](https://github.com/hesh-alghamdi/FEND/tree/3-weather-journal)
This was our first project using APIs, Nodejs and Express. We used a weather service that would provide what today's forcast and we would display it for the user.

## 4. [Sentiment Analysis Applications](https://github.com/hesh-alghamdi/FEND/tree/4-building-tool)
This project was and introduction to Webpack and Babel. It was almost the same as the third project. But this one is for testing the sentimentality of an article that the user would provide the link for.

## 5. [Capston Project "Trip Planner"](https://github.com/hesh-alghamdi/FEND/tree/5-capstone)
This was our last project before getting our certificats. This project was intended for us to test all of the knowledge that we gained throughout the course. We were asked to use 3 different APIs. We get the data from one API then pass it to the next. The project idea is a Trip planner that would show you the forecast of today and the forecast expected for the next 16 days so you would plan ahead.
