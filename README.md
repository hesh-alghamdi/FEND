# Weather App
Testing my abilities on using Node.js and Express.

## What have been done?
- I used OpenWeatherMap.org API to retrive weather data.
- I implemented retriving the weather data by inputing city name. (ZIP codes are not working with Saudi cities AFAIK)
- Simple layout for small screens and wide screens.
